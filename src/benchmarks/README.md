# Benchmarking
A very simple benchmarks for the T86 and debuggers. Only one benchmark can be
run at one invocation of the program. This is intentional, to have as clean
environment as possible. To run a benchmark, use the built executable and
the name of the benchmark (e.g., `./build/benchmarks/native_bench PrimesContinue`).
